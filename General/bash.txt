            grep "\"testing test\"" bash_commands.txt

    | - piping; sends standard output of command as standard input to another command

Create and modify files and directories
    mkdir - creates a new directory 
    rmdir - removes or deletes a directory 

    touch - creates a new file
    rm - removes or deletes a file

File permissions and ownership 
    ls -l = displays permissions to files and directories
    ls -a = displays hidden files 
    ls -la = displays permssions to files and dirs including hidden files 

Change permissions  
    chmod g+w,o-r access.txt
    chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,o+rwx login_sessions.txt
    chmod u=r,g=r,o=r login_sessions.txt
        sets or assigns permissions exactly as specified 
        this command would make user, group, and other only have read permissions

Add and delete users 
    sudo - grants temporary super user permissions 
    useradd - adds user to system
        can only be done by root or sudo user 
        
        sudo useradd salesrep7

        options 
            -g = sets the users default group or primary group 
                sudo useradd -g security fgarcia
            -G = adds user to additional groups or supplemental/secondary groups

    userdel - removes user from system
        does not delete files in user's home directory without: 
            -r option

        Note: When you create a new user in Linux, a group with the same name as the user is automatically created and the user is the only member of that group. After removing users, it is good practice to clean up any such empty groups that may remain behind.
            sudo groupdel researcher9
    usermod - modifies existing user accounts 
        -g and -G work 

        sudo usermod -g executive fgarcia
