Note: The recommended sequence of commands for saving a file with the nano text editor is to use CTRL+O to tell nano to save the file and then use CTRL+X to exit immediately.
In this web-based lab environment, the CTRL+O command is intercepted by your web browser and is interpreted as a request to save the web page. The sequence used here is a commonly used alternative that achieves the same end result.

mkdir logs
rmdir temp
mv Q3patches.txt /home/analyst/reports/
rm tempnotes.txt
touch tasks.txt
nano tasks.txt
cat tasks.txt
