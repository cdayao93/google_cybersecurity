IPV6
  Version: This field indicates the IP version. For an IPv6 header, IPv6 is used.
  Traffic Class: This field is similar to the IPv4 Type of Service field. The Traffic Class field provides information about the packet's priority or class to help with packet delivery.
  Flow Label: This field identifies the packets of a flow. A flow is the sequence of packets sent from a specific source. 
  Payload Length: This field specifies the length of the data portion of the packet.
  Next Header: This field indicates the type of header that follows the IPv6 header such as TCP.
  Hop Limit: This field is similar to the IPv4 Time to Live field. The Hop Limit limits how long a packet can travel in a network before being discarded.
  Source Address: This field specifies the source address of the sender.
  Destination Address: This field specifies the destination address of the receiver.

Open-source network protocl analyzer.It uses a graphical user interface (GUI), which makes it easier to visualize network communications for packet analysis purposes

Different types of comparison operators for display filtering
Operator type           Symbol  Abbreviation
Equal                    ==        eq
Not Equal                !=        ne
Greater than             >         gt
Less than                <         lt
Greater than or equal to >=        ge
Less than or equal to    <=        le

Combine comparison operators with Boolean logical operators like 'and' and 'or' to create complez display filters

The 'contains' operator is used to filter packets that contain an exact match of a string of text. 
Here is an example of a filter that displays all HTTP streams that match the keyword "moved". 

The 'matches' operator is used to filter packets based on the regular expression (regex) that's specified

PROTOCOL FILTERING
Protocol filtering is one of the simplest ways you can use display filters. 
You can simply enter the name of the protocol to filter. 
For example, to filter for DNS packets simply type 'dns' in the filter toolbar. Here is a list of some protocols you can filter for:

dns
http
ftp
ssh
arp
telnet
icmp

FILTER FOR MAC ADDRESS
eth.addr == 00:70:f4:23:18:c4

FILTER FOR IP ADDRESS
ip.addr == 172.21.224.2 -> Filters for SpecificIP address
ip.src == 10.10.10.10 -> Filters for packets originating from a specific destination IP address
ip.dst == 4.4.4.4 -> filters packets delivered to a specific destination 

PORT FILTERING
udp.port == 53
tcp.port == 25
