sudo tcpdump -D

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5
    -i eth0: Capture data specifically from the eth0 interface.
    -v: Display detailed packet data.
    -c5: Capture 5 packets of data.

In the example data at the start of the packet output, tcpdump reported that it was listening on the eth0 interface, and it provided information on the link type and the capture size in bytes:
tcpdump: listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
On the next line, the first field is the packet's timestamp, followed by the protocol type, IP:
22:24:18.910372 IP 
The verbose option, -v, has provided more details about the IP packet fields, such as TOS, TTL, offset, flags, internal protocol type (in this case, TCP (6)), and the length of the outer IP packet in bytes:
(tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 5802, offset 0, flags [DF], proto TCP (6), length 134)
The specific details about these fields are beyond the scope of this lab. But you should know that these are properties that relate to the IP network packet.

In the next section, the data shows the systems that are communicating with each other:
