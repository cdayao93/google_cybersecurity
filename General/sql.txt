Basic queries 
    SELECT - indicates which columns to return 

    FROM - which table to query
        SELECT employee_id, device_id
        FROM employees;

    * - "all" 
        SELECT * 
        FROM employees;

    ORDER BY - sequences records returned based on a specified column or columns
        SELECT customerid, city, country
        FROM customers
        ORDER BY city;

        DESC - changes sorting order
            SELECT customerid, city, country
            FROM customers
            ORDER BY city DESC;

        sorting based on multiple columns
            SELECT customerid, city, country
            FROM customers
            ORDER BY country, city;
            
                sorts by country, then for rows with the same country it sorts those by city

Basic filters 
    WHERE - indicates condition for a filter 
        SELECT * 
        FROM log_in_attempts
        WHERE country = 'USA';

    LIKE - used with where and % to search for pattern 
        SELECT * 
        FROM log_in_attempts
        WHERE country LIKE "US%";

    % - substitutes for any number of chars 
    _ - subsittutes for only 1 char

Common data types 
    string 
    numeric 
    date and time 

Operators 
    = 
    >
    <
    <> or !=
    >=
    <=

    SELECT * 
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE time > '18:00';

    BETWEEN - operator that filters # of dates within a range 
        SELECT * 
        FROM machines 
        WHERE OS_patch_date BETWEEN '2021-03-01' AND '2021-09-01';

        inclusive of specified dates

Filters with AND, OR, and NOT
    AND - both conditions must be met 
        SELECT * 
        FROM machines 
        WHERE operating_system = 'OS 1' AND email_client = 'Email Client 1';

    OR - either condition can be met 
        SELECT * 
        FROM machines 
        WHERE operating_system = 'OS 1' OR operating_system = 'OS 3';

    NOT - negates a condition 
        SELECT * 
        FROM machines 
        WHERE NOT operating_system = 'OS 3';

        only works on a single condition

Join tables 
    INNER JOIN - returns rows matching on a specified column that exists in more than one table 
        resulting table will include rows that contain matching values on selected column

        SELECT username, office, operating_system
        FROM employees 
        INNER JOIN machines on employees.employee_id = machines employee_id;

        Note: If a column exists in both of the tables, it is returned twice when SELECT * is used.

        SELECT username, operating_system, employees.device_id
        FROM  employees
        INNER JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;
            Note: In the example query, username and operating_system only appear in one of the two tables, so they are written with just the column name. On the other hand, because device_id appears in both tables, it's necessary to indicate which one to return by specifying both the table and column name (employees.device_id).
            

    outer joins 
        LEFT JOIN - returns all records of first table but only returns rows from the second table that match specified column 
        RIGHT JOIN - opposite of LEFT JOIN 
        FULL OUTER JOIN - returns all records from both tables  

Aggregate functions 
    COUNT - returns total number of rows from query 
    AVG 
    SUM 

    place keyword after SELECT:
        SELECT COUNT(firstname)
        FROM customers;

    SELECT COUNT(firstname)
    FROM customers
    WHERE country = 'USA';
