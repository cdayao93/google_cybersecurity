sudo tcpdump -i any -v -c 1
    -i = interface 
        "any available interface"
    -v = verbose 
    -c = count; how many packets to look at 

    Note: tcpdump options that are written using short options can be written with or without a space between the option and its value. For example, sudo tcpdump -i any -c 3 and sudo tcpdump -iany -c3 are equivalent commands.

Options 
    -w = save sniffed packets to a packet capture file
        sudo tcpdump -i any -w packetcapture.pcap
    -r = read a packet capture file
        sudo tcpdump -r packetcapture.pcap
    -v = verbose 
        3 levels of verbosity: -v, -vv, -vvv 
    -c = count 
    -D = list all network interfaces available on system
    -n = disable auto name resolution for ports and IP addresses 
        auto name resolution does reverse DNS lookup

        sudo tcpdump -r packetcapture.pcap -v -n

Expressions 
    and, or, not 

    sudo tcpdump -r packetcapture.pcap -n 'ipv4 and port 80

    can use parenthesis to group and prioritize 
        ipv4 and (port 80 or port 443)
